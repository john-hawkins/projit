Projit is a utility for managing Data Science Project structure, properties, data, experiments & collaboration.

The goal of this project is to allow data science teams to work on
projects in a structured and standardized way. The projit utility
allows you to establish a project with a centralised meta-data repository.
This meta-data is used by the application and package to facilitate loosely 
coupled communication between scripts and experiments. 
For example, projit provides a python library that can be used inside experiments and
scripts so references to training, evaluation and test data sets is simple.

In additon the project can be initialised according to a standardized layout
so that the diectory structure is familiar to all team members.

This project was inspired by a combination of other projects:
* [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) 
* [The Python CookieCutter Application](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/)
* [The Git Source Control Utility]()

To be released and distributed via setuptools/PyPI/pip for Python 3.
 
Additional detail available in the [documentation](https://projit.readthedocs.io)


## Notes

Initial implementation is focused allowing the user to initialise a project, and then
modify it using a python package that can be called independently in scripts across 
the project structure. This creates a central authority for updating and retrieving
info about data sets and experimental results.

## Usage

You can use this application multiple ways

Use the runner:

```
./projit-runner.py init "Test Project" 
```

Invoke the directory as a package:

```
python -m projit init "Test Project"
```

Or simply install the package and use the command line application directly
as shown in the process below:

# Installation

Installation from the source tree:

```
python setup.py install
```

(or via pip from PyPI):

```
pip install projit
```

Now, the ``projit`` command is available::

```
projit init "Test Project"
```

This will initialise the current directory as a Data Science Project using
the default template. Please refer to the 
[documentation for more detail on projit commands](https://projit.readthedocs.io).
